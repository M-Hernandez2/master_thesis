ABSTRACT:
Saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers is a growing issue for coastlines around the world. Compound effects of climate change and human use of natural resources leave these crucial freshwater sources at risk. Once groundwater surpasses a salinity threshold, the water is rendered unsuitable for irrigative use. The future impacts of climate and hydrologic changes on coastal groundwater supplies and dependent farms remain uncertain. This issue is present in Dover, Delaware, USA where there is a large agricultural sector along the saline Delaware Bay. This study investigates how projected changes in local hydroclimate influence aquifer salinization at 16 irrigation wells. To do this, we use a three-dimensional, coupled groundwater flow and contaminant transport model, SEAWAT, to evaluate the impacts of future changes in sea level, groundwater recharge, and groundwater pumping over a 75-year period. The results identify wells at risk of salinization, revealing that three of the 16 are highly vulnerable, while four face moderate risk. Using the delta moment-independent method of sensitivity analysis, we conclude that temperature, followed by precipitation, has the largest influence on salinization, while sea level rise has the smallest impact. These findings highlight that groundwater extraction is the primary driver of aquifer and well salinization in Dover, DE. Increased pumping for crop irrigation due to climatic changes could push coastal aquifers past a salinity tipping point, threatening crop production and farmersâ€™ livelihoods.
